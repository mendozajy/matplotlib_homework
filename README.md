#Here's a link to my homework. I probably approached it differently as I didn't use for loops  or merged data sets for the box charts.  
#I used. unstack, .last, .groupby and had quartiles run through a sorted data frame instead of looping.
#I had to this homework with more simple #concepts. 
#Also, many people interpreted the Bar chart question differently.  I read it as we had to plot each mouse,per treatment over the duration of 25 months (the length of the study).  #That is why i have ten bars per drug.
